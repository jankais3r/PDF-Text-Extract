# PDF Text Extract
No-dependency Python code that extracts text from a PDF file

By default, the script extracts text from file called `sample.pdf`. There is also a commented code showing you how to extract text from an online PDF file (uncomment rows 7 & 11).

In my testing the script hasn't always been succesfull at extracting text from complex PDFs, so some more work might be required to support those.
